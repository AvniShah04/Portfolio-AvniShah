# Final Project Part 3 #

## PROJECT SCOPE: ##

I began this project by identifying a very broad subject of women's progress/ women's development as my focus. In part one my focus was on identifying data sources for the subject. While identifying these data sources I realized the subject was very broad and I was unable to coherently and convincingly present all aspects as this problem. I then narrowed it down to women in leadership positions. I did briefly consider narrowing it down further to a single field. However, due to data constrictions, I decided to consider general leadership. 
I worked to identify recent and relevant data sets to understand the scope of the problem in the current state.

## AUDIENCE SCOPE: ##
Similar to my project scope I consider a very broad audience for the first two parts of my project.The way I approached the problem considering all those who could benefit from this project subject. For the first two parts, I considered women, organizations, and the general public as my audience. As I went through my research interviews, I realized that all different types of audience wanted to focus on different aspects of the project. I realized this again as I began to finalize my call to action. The call to action for a very wide audience / different groups in the audience was difficult to incorporate into a single project. For my third segment I narrowed the scope to focus on organizations. I included:

a) *Start-up firms:*
Since these firms are still establishing their company culture, understanding the impact of gender inequality and wage gap could help them take proactive steps to combat it.
It is also aimed to provide these firms with simple and economical steps that could contribute to an increase in women's representation.

b) *Large Scale Firms:*
I included these firms as a part of my audience as wage inequality and lack of women leadership is more prevalent in these firms. This project could help them identify their shortfalls as well as better understand the steps they could take to combat the inequality and promote women inclusion.

## VISUALIZATIONS: ##
As I considered the different visualization I selected for this project I wanted to explore different types of infographics since It was not something I had used extensively for the other assignments and I thought they would be a clear way to display my data. 

## PROGRESS ##

I worked on  incorporating the appropriate feedback from my research interviews as well as incorporating the changes I felt had a better result by exploring different aspects of flourish, infogram and canva.

a)*Changing images:* 

My initial project had images that were highly pixelated, I change those images for images with a better resolution to improve the impact of the project

b) *Increasing content for examples:*

I added more details to every section to flesh out the details of the project while also editing out unnecessary information.

c) *Changing the presentation of the data on women participation:*

This was my biggest change in the project. In part 2 I have 4 bar charts showing women's participation in different fields. However, after my interviews, I realized the section was not having the needed impact since the data was not contrasted against the number of males in the same category. I decided to change the presentation of the data. I made the charts stacked column charts while using grey color to show the percentage of male participation. I also used the slide function in flourish so that the viewers were not getting overwhelmed by the number of graphs and were viewing them sequentially. I also added written matter to support the information on the graphs. 

d)*Including sections with important figures and quotes :*

I added additional sections throughout my presentation. Identifying important quotes and figures to highlight the problem and also allow the audience to focus on a single piece of information without distraction.

e)*Changing the infograhics:*

I changed the earlier inforgraphics to be better representations of the data, with the figures representing women and men instead of only people.

f)*Changing the color scheme:*

Another major change throughout the project was to change the color schemes to be even across the project. As I did not want to reinforce the stereotype by using the pink color for women I ensure to use yellow where women were being represented through the project. I also ensure men were represented in blue. This ensured there was uniformity throughout the project.

g)*Including details in the call to action:*

I had included a brief outline of my call to action in the previous project submission. For my final project I added details, images and used button to link to other organizations that could prove to be further help.

## FUTURE WORKS ##

The following are possible future avenues to develop this project further:

a) Include a timeline marking the important events in women leadership

b)Include material in the call to action specifically for individuals.

c)Included more details on the wage gap across different countries.
