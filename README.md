<h2> Hello Everyone! Welcome to my Telling stories with data portfolio! </h2>

<h3> About Me: </h3> 

 My name is Avni Shah.I use the pronouns She/her/hers.I am born and raised in Pune, India.I have completed my undergraduate degree in dental studies from India. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Healthcare Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. A few quick facts about me!

 - I have worked for 2 years as a dentist and treated over 500 patients

<h3> Career Goals and Aspirations: </h3>

 Most of my education and work experience has been focused on the healthcare sector.Its an area I am very passionate about. I have slowly pivoted from the clinical sidde of healthcare to the consulting, management and research end of healthcare. As I look forward to graduating this May I hope to have the opportunity to utlize my present skillset in strategy, operations and market research and further develop my skills. 

<h3> What I wish to learn from telling stories with data:  </h3>

As I worked through the various courses of my graduate program I realized that while I have developed skills in gathering and cleaning relevant data, I am yet to understand how to ensure it has the most impact. Alot of the work I did through my internship was focused around presenting my research on various marketing strategies.It is critical to the success of projects to be able to present the data in a way that conveys the message I wish to put forth. I realized this is a skillset I wanted to develop further. I am hoping through this course I am able to make my messaging more impactful and convey the necessary details in a succient manner. I hope better understand the use of space and colour to help me create the best narrative for my work.
