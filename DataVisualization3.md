** Assignment 3 & 4 **

# BACKGROUND #

For the assignment I selected a data visualization from the international educational statistics website. This data was collected in 2007 and analysized by Friedrich Huebler. The aim of the analysis was to better understand the difference in the adult and youth literacy rates in different regions of the world. This differnece would then be used to determine the area of focus for education and literacy resources.The analysis spanned 10 regions and included both youth  and adult literacy rates. I selected this data set as I am very interested in understanding the interlinked relation of health and education. 

# SELECTED DATA VISULIZATION #

There were 2 data visulizations associated with this data set one focusing on the different regions and the their literacy rates. The second one gavea zoomed in view of a cluster of the data points seen in the first visualization. I focused on improving the first visulization to ensure the data was more readable and easier to interpret.
The data visualization is below:

# CRITIQUE #
As I began to analyse the visualization, I considered what I liked about it, what I didn't like, and what I would like to improve.
