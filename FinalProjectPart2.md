# FINAL PROJECT PART 2 #
In this segment I focused on completing my initial draft on Shorthand and user research interviews.

# INITAL DRAFT #
I used the sketches I created for my Part 1 to develop the material and images for my ShortHand draft. I tried to incorporate the changes from the feedback I recieved on the assignment as well as include additional elements that improved the visualizations.I realized that some of the inital sketches did not translate as well digitally and needed to be modified. I used ShortHand to create my final project. I also used Canva and Flourish for different elements of the final project. The present draft is only the wireframe for the final project and will undergo changes as suggested by my user research interviews.

User Research Interviews:
There were 3 main things I included in my research interview:
- Target Audience
- Approach to identifying the individuals
- Interview Script
- Feedback 
- Changes to be included in part 3

# Target Audience #

1) Women : Since my subject is on women in leadership my target audience included women. I hope to use the project to encourage women to pursue leadership roles in various fields. It is also intended to create an awareness among women about the disparity that exists in wages and leadership positions.

2) Organizations: The other audience for my project is organizations and firms. It is to sow case the root causes of the disparity in the work place. It is also intended to push the organizations to undertake initiatives that increase women participations at all levels of the organization and reduce the wage gap between the genders.

3) General Public: While the project is focused on discrimination and inequlity in the work place, I believe , even the general public would be a potential audience for this project as it brings forth the effect of disparity in treatment for women and speaks to the need for a change in mindset when it comes to the progress of women.

# Approach to identifying the individuals #

When I considered my the individuals I wanted to interview, I wanted to ensure I had a wide range of age, genders and economic backgrounds.

- Age: The difference in age ranges was to see how the age gap would change the views to the matter included as well as the change in perception to the visualizations used and colour schemes. I have also incuded some newer elements like inforgraphs and background images, I want to see how they are recieved by people of difffernet ages.

- Genders: I want as wide a gender representation as possible for this project as the entire project is based on gender discrimation in leadership roles. It would be great to see the contrasting views to the material and visualization for different genders. My earlier interviews have also made me realize the views on color schemes, data type and further suggestions varies between genders.

- Economic Background: Having people who come from a variety of economic backgrounds, education levels and job profiles would help me identify the change in focus for different audiences. This can dictate how I can modify my project to best serve my target audience.
