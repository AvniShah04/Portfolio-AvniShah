WHY THIS TOPIC?
This topic is intended to create awareness about the dire situation of women in leadership positions, while highlighting the few successful ones. It is meant to bring light on the
gender disparity and the challenges faced by women. Through this subject I hope to motivate individuals and firms to proactively contribute to inclusion of women at all levels.
